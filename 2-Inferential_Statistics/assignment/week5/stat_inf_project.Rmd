## Part 1: Data

The General Social Survey (GSS) by NORC at the University of Chicago claims to be a comprehensive, unbiased perspective on American opinion on contemporary issues and trends ^[[About the GSS](http://gss.norc.org/About-The-GSS)]. The survey ensued in 1972 and continues till date, while trying to improve and ameliorate bias with each iteration. The GSS has employed a biennial, dual sample design since 1994, i.e., the GSS conducts the survey in even years with two samples.

### Study Design

The GSS, since its inception, has been using a rotation scheme as a means to alleviate bias introduced due to question order. The intrinsic ordering of questions can have a primacy and recency effect which distort response behavior. ^[[Rotating Panel Design - Encyclopedia of Survey Research Methods](https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/encyclopedia-of-survey-research-methods/n500.xml)] From a statistical standpoint, rotation is advantageous when data needs to be aggregated. In retrospective, rotation doesn't work when a correlation analysis needs to be conducted. The receny effect will be more apparent as participants will tend to associate recent options with the presented scale. ^[[Rotation - SoSci Survey](https://www.soscisurvey.de/help/doku.php/en:create:rotation)]

The rotation scheme also allows the survey to include "Permanent items" and "Regular items" as each set of items only appeared two-thirds of time. A noted disadvantage of this approach was that it results in gaps (or NAs) in the data. However, the impact of such gaps can be reduced during aggregation. 

The rotation, across-time design was discontinued in 1987 as it causes an imbalance in the time-series. According to GSS Appendix Q^[[GSS Codebook: Appendix Q](https://gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_AppendixQ.pdf)], "a split-ballot design was introduced, which splits the rotations "across random ballots (or sub-samples) within each survey rather than across surveys (and years)". Figure 1 shows how split-ballot rotation took place, starting 1988.

![Fig. 1: Split-ballot designed introduced in 1988. Splits are done accross ballots and not surveys/years. (Source: GSS Codebook Appendix Q)](img/ballot_design.jpg)

### Sampling design

According to Appendix A^[[GSS Codebook: Appendix A](https://gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_AppendixA.pdf)], survey samples through 1972 to 1974 followed a modified probability sample which was then conducted alongside a full probability sample design for 1975 to 1977 surveys. The variable `sample` denotes this separation. The appendix also states, "investigators who have applied statistical tests to previous General Social Survey data should continue to apply those tests". For the sake of simplicity and this project, we will assume a random sample for years 1972 through 1977. Finally, years 1977 and above used a full probability sample rather than this transition methodology, making it safe to assume a random sample.

### Causality

Since there is no random assignment, blocking or control involved, the study can only be deemed as observation (as opposed to an experiment). Since there is no guarantee that all confounding variables can be examined or measured in an observational study, no casual relationship can be established.

### Generalizability

The survey was only conducted in English till 2006, any statistics involving non-English speaking participants until 2006 should note this. Furthermore, the survey was conducted in Spanish in addition to English speakers, which is said to include "60-65%" of the language exclusions. 

The sample is conducted as a multi-stage sample with further block quotas. Each block constitutes of a quota based on sex, age, and employment status. In order to reduce the bias introduced by "not-at-home" cases, interviewers are instructed to interview only after 1500 hrs on weekdays or during weekend and/or holidays. The timings are based on empirical evidence from previous surveys.

The primary sampling units are Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas and counties which are stratified by race, region and age. Within these primary sampling units, blocks were selected with probabilities proportional to size. Furthermore, interviewers have been advised to start from the northwest corner of the block and continue until the quota for the block has been met. 

According to Appendix B ^[[GSS Codebook: Appendix B](https://gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_AppendixB.pdf)], all interviews are trained by area supervisors in order to minimize bias. Appendix B also includes a holistic list of specifications to be followed by an interviewer. GSS also documents their survey programming and also includes instructions on handling anomalous cases. ^[[List of GSS questionnaires](http://gss.norc.org/Get-Documentation/questionnaires)]. Figure 2 shows an example for a response.

## Part 2: Research question

A rise in support in same-sex marriage has changed the attitudes and laws countries have had on homosexuality. Prior to 2003 in the United States same-sex sexual activity was illegal in fourteen states ^[[LGBT rights in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States)]. On June 26, 2015, the supreme court legalized same-sex marriages in all states and required states to recognize out-of-state same sex marriage. ^[[Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_legislation_in_the_United_States)] This was in response to the landmark civil rights case, now termed as, _Obergefell v. Hodges_ ^[[Obergefell v. Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges)]

According to a Pew Research study^[[The Global Divide on Homosexuality Persists](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/06/25/global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists/)], The United states has seen a rise of 12% in acceptance of homosexuality from 74% in 2002 to 86% in 2019. In developing countries like India, where laws against criminalization of the LGBTQ community have been revoked as of 2019. ^[[LGBT rights in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_India)]. Furthermore, the same Pew Research study, quotes a 22% increase in acceptance of homosexuality from 15% in 2002 to 37% in 2019. Additionally, acceptance of homosexuality seems to entail any legalization or decriminalized of LGBTQ rights. 

There is an apparent trend as shown in figure 3, in the rise of acceptance of homosexuality in the United States, since 2015. 
However, it would be statistically incorrect to say legalization and acceptance are associated without proper evidence. Legalization may be one of the several factors that influences one's decision of homosexuality. Other influential factors may include religion, education, political status, ideologies and so on.

![Acceptance of homosexuality in soceity (Source: Pew Research Center)](img/PG_2020.06.25_Global-Views-Homosexuality_0-05.png)

Unfortunately, despite the increase in net acceptance, there seems to be a divide among members of the religious community. The same study mentions "significant differences" across highly religious and less religious countries and their acceptance of homosexuality. Religious reforms and upbringing can have an adverse impact on people who associate themselves with the LGTBQ community. Countries that draw out laws based on religious reforms such as India (predominately Hindu) and Indonesia (primarily Muslim) can have a negative effect on people who identify themselves as homosexual. It is therefore important to understand whether religion had a significant impact on policy makers and their decision to legalize same-sex marriage. 

A research question can be drawn out as follows:

> Is there a relationship between confidence in organized religion and acceptance of homosexual sexual relations in the United States in the year 2002?

It should be noted that this project aims to understand the impact of one religious factor on acceptance of another single factor of the LGBTQ community. This study will enable us to understand whether people who tend to believe more in organized religion (a structured system of faith) tend to not accept sexual relationships among members of the same sex.

Prior to the 2015 bill, several states hadn't legalized same-sex marriage. It would be interesting to observe the association between these two categorical variables. Furthermore, as according to figure 3, acceptance percentages are over 15% lower in 2003 than those in 2019. Additionally since the earliest date of enactment/ruling for the same-sex marriage law is November 18, 2003 (Massachusetts) and effective on May 17, 2004, the impact of legalization would be less apparent. Although the impact would not be entirely eradicated since any inferences will be drawn out on the basis of observation.
