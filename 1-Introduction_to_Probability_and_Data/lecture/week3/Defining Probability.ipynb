Bayesian methods have been largely popularized by revolutionary advances in computational technology and methods during the last 20 years."

    "- This is why, as we roll a fair die many times, we expect the proportion of say, fives, to settle down to one-sixth. While earlier in the sequence, with too few rolls, we might not exactly get one in six fives. For example, if you roll a die say, six times, there's no guarantee that you're going to get at least one five in there. But if you roll the die say, 600 or 6,000 times, you would expect to see about one-sixth of the time to get a five. Similarly, why it would be more surprising to see three heads in 1,000 coin flips, than three heads in 10 or 100 coin flips."

    "- The probability is still 50%. So, the probability of heads on the11th toss is the same as the probability of heads on the 10th toss, or any previous tosses, which is 0.5. Each toss is independent, hence, the outcome of the next toss does not depend on the outcome of the previous toss. Another way of thinking about it is that the coin is memoryless. It doesn't remember what happened before and say to itself, well let me roll over on the other side next time. In other words, the coin is not due for a tail. "
